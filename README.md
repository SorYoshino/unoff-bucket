# unoff-bucket

This is an unofficial bucket, either slightly modified from the official bucket's manifest or used for testing a PR submission to the official bucket.

## How do I install these manifests?

After manifests have been committed and pushed, run the following:

```powershell
scoop bucket add unoff-bucket https://github.com/SorYoshino/unoff-bucket
scoop install unoff-bucket/<manifestname>
```
