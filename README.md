# unoff-bucket

This is an unofficial bucket, and its current purposes are as follows:

- Storing manifests for personal use
- Testing pull requests submitted to the official buckets and tracking their subsequent updates

## Notes

- This repository is periodically cleaned to remove manifests that are no longer needed for tracking. **Installing applications using manifests from this repository is not recommended**.
- This repository only accepts follow-up tracking requests for manifests submitted to the official buckets. All other types of requests will not be accepted.
  - For manifests that have been submitted to the official buckets and also exist in this repository, if any issues arise, you may open an issue. I will address it as soon as possible.
